![](Documents/piicodev-pressure-sensor-ms5637.jpg)

This is the repo for the Core Electronics [PiicoDev Pressure Sensor](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE07832).


Our PiicoDev® Pressure Sensor is perfect for measuring barometric pressure or infering altitude from air pressure - the on-board MS5637 is capable of measuring differences as small as 13cm! The accurate, MEMs pressure sensor is very sensitive, factory calibrated, low power and easy to use - forfect for home weather stations, detecting changes in altitude or pneumatic-based control projects.
